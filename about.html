            <h3 style="color:red;">MY JOURNEY</h3>
            <p>I studied at Christuraja Matriculation Higher 
                Secondary School in Marthandam for 14 years and 
                completed my SSLC and HSC public examinations there. 
                After completing my schooling, I started studying 
                programming courses at the CADD Center, where I 
                learned C, C++, Python, and completed a Diploma in 
                Python. During these courses, I worked on several 
                projects, including a grading system for marks in C++, 
                a flight booking website for administrators in Django, 
                and received certificates for my achievements.

                In 2022, I joined Ponjesly College of Engineering, 
                where I pursued a degree in Computer Science & 
                Engineering and graduated in 2026. I have the ability 
                to design simple and responsive web pages that 
                interact well with users. Whatever I do, I strive to 
                apply my knowledge to the best of my ability. 
                Thank you!
            </p>
